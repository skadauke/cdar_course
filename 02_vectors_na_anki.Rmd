### Optional Resources

Here are some resources if you're interested in further exploring spaced repetition and Anki:

*	[Anki 2 download page](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
*	You can also set up an [Ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/) account to sync your decks between devices and review cards on the web.
* [Anki 2: Shared decks and review basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS2G-k2hQyg&yt)
*	[Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules). A classic guide to creating efficient flashcards. Don’t worry about the references to the different versions of SuperMemo, it’s a program similar to Anki.
* [Anki Essentials](https://foggymountainpass.com/anki-essentials/). A practical illustrated guide to Anki. This ebook used to be free but is now $5 to download. Here are some [sample chapters](https://alexvermeer.com/wp-content/uploads/Anki-Essentials-Free-Chapters.pdf).
