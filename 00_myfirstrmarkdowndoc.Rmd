# My First R Markdown Document!
## More hashtags = smaller header

Here is some text and a list:

* It's *easy* to style text for **emphasis**.
* It's also easy to add a [link](http://www.massgeneral.org).

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
summary(x)
```

The first random number in `x` is `r x[1]`.

## Including plots

The `echo = FALSE` option hides R code.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
hist(x)
```
