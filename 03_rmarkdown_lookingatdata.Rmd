<!-- TODO: 

✓ Create patients data set
  - subset of Framingham - period 3 only
- Create short R Markdown document
  - Create project in RStudio
  - Download framingham data
  - Read_excel data (will have to install tidyverse; write out this code which installs and loads it if needed)
  - Look at data: str, summary
  - Count NA's (sum, mean) in each column and decide whether that's a problem
  - Look at the top 6 rows
  - extract rows from top and lower quintile of hdl data, and summarize outcomes
  - perform a t test to see if the difference in any_chd is statistically significant (assume that the any_chd data is normally distributed)
- Review Ankis and create .html, .pdf, .apkg

TO THE INSTRUCTOR:
- Go over cards (but quickly, 15' for work, 15' for review)
- Hand out R Markdown cheat sheet
- In class: Reproduce the R Markdown document framingham.Rmd (hand out print out with
  some of the code obscured) *** Have class reproduce My First Rmd Doc instead of framingham! ***

## Session 3: Data Frames and R Markdown

| Date    | Time      | Location |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| 9/11/17 | 2 PM     | GRJ245   |

### Objectives

*	Become familiar with the following aspects of R:
    * Data frames
* Learn how to examine a data frame to understand its structure and contents
*	Learn how to create and "knit" an R Markdown document

### Pre-Session Activities

Please view the following:

*	**[7 min]** [R Markdown Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKsBiCUdS3w) (Roger Peng, JHU Biostatistics)[^1]

[^1]: Don’t worry about the R commands for simulation and regression models. Focus on the big picture: how to create and knit a simple R Markdown document.

Swirl modules:

* R Programming: Matrices and Data Frames
* R Programming: Looking at Data

### Materials

* [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)[^2]
* [Framingham data set (Excel)](framingham.xlsx)
* [Framingham Case Study (PDF)](03_framingham.pdf)
* [Session 3 slides (Slidy)](03_ankis.html)
* [Session 3 hand-out (no answers)](03_ankis_no_answers.pdf)
* [Session 3 Anki cards (.apkg)](03_ankis.apkg)
