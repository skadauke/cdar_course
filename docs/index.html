TODO

- More links
- Talk about the peculiarities of teaching doctors?
- Create about.Rmd page? Or link to about.me? Should have a CV, picture, Github, and short bio
- Fork swirl?
  - Could remove swirl modules I don't want to cover
  - Could modify swirl modules as I please
  - Could have module completions be communicated via a simple RESTful API instead of email (alternative: gmailR?)
  - Could create dplyr/ggplot2 modules without base graphics

<h3>Course Description</h3>
<!-- Intro pgh: about reasons why clinicians generally don't script their analyses.

- Learning a programming language is a large upfront investment in effort and time. Time is at a premium because of patient care obligations. Moreover, physicians don't see themselves are professional data analysts and therefore have little interest in exploring alternative methods to performing data analysis from what they already know. 

- Physicians are skeptical of promises that information technology innovations will simplify things for them. This is probably due to negative experiences with electronic health record software.

- Physicians tend to model other, more senior, physicians. They consult these role models as well as knowedge bases curated by experts who are also medical doctors.

- Why not leave physicians out of the data analysis??

- Physicians know details about the disease and are often also intimately involved in the data collection. 

- Physicians will tend to insist on being a part of the analysis as they are the ones who came up with the scientific question and are therefore motivated in seeing the outcomes.

- Does this mean that we need to train physicians to be biostatisticians and programmers?

- Heck no! We merely want physicians to be comfortable with the technologies that allow reproducible data analyses and then, after having had a first go at the analysis, consult with more experienced personnel, such as biostatisticians, in a efficient fashion.

- So what's the solution to these issues?

- Teach reproducible data analysis in the most intuitive fashion possible.
- Use real clinical data
- Get to the "good parts" i.e. processing data frames and visualizing as soon as possible
- Use modern teaching methods that maximize the effort / retention ratio.


- Unique issue with clinical data: highly protected
  - HIPAA standards
    - Minimum necessary
    - Need to know
  - Necessitates de-identification of data which should be done early in the data analysis pipeline.
  - It may be necessary to provide a record showing who accessed the data before de-identification
  - Makes some commonly used tools in the data science community inappropriate (e.g. GitHub) for sharing primary data sets
  - It is often necessary to explain exactly what data will be collected prior to the study (IRB)
  - Electronic data capture (EDC) tools exist that integrate data collection, auditing, and de-identification
    - The investigator designs "data instruments" that allow collection of data in a study-specific format
    - Data is entered via an encrypted connection to the server via a Web interface and is then stored in a HIPAA-compliant fashion
      - Access is logged for audits
    - After data entry is finished, de-identified data sets can be exported for downstream analysis in a statistical software package such as R
    - A widely used EDC tool is REDCap which was developed by Vanderbilt University and is free for non-commercial use
-->
<p>The explosive growth in clinical data requires the judicious use of more sophisticated analysis tools than was necessary in the past. There is a current and ongoing discourse about the characteristics of best practices in data analysis. Chief among them are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>: an independent investigator who possesses the raw data should be able to perform the same data analytic steps and arrive at the same result.</li>
<li><strong>Translatability</strong>: it should be possible to reuse or modify a data analytic workflow to accommodate new or similar data.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of communication</strong>: a data analysis should be presented in a way that explains both the process and the results of the analysis in a complete and meaningful way.</li>
</ul>
<p>This course will introduce participants to <strong>literate programming</strong> (LP), in which explanatory comments are interspersed with snippets of code in a single document. LP allows for documentation of data collection details as well as the rationale for specific analysis design decisions right along with code that precisely documents the data analysis. LP eases review of the data analysis for methodological issues and data errors. LP analyses are reproducible and can easily be modified to accommodate new or updated data.</p>
<p>We will use the R statistical programming language, because it is free, cross-platform, widely used, and supports LP via the <strong>knitr</strong> and <strong>R Markdown</strong> packages.</p>

<div id="course-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p>The goal of the proposed course is to introduce clinicians to a reproducible and translatable workflow for clinical data analysis. Clear communication of the results of the analysis will be emphasized as well. By the end of the course, participants will be able to use R Markdown to create fully reproducible data analysis reports.</p>
</div>
<div id="requirements" class="section level3">
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>This course is built on the <strong>flipped classroom</strong> model in which specific activities (readings, videos, etc.) are assigned prior to each session. <strong>The in-person sessions will closely follow the assigned material, and participants will probably not be able to follow class if they did not complete the assignments beforehand.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I highly recommend you bring a personal laptop to class.</strong> It doesn’t matter which operating system it runs, as all the software discussed in this course runs on both Windows and macOS. While it will be technically possible to follow the in-person sessions without one, the learning experience will be much improved with a laptop.</li>
